This repo is divided in varios sections (I will be adding new sections in the future):

  - Evolutionary Strategies
  
 
# Evolutionary Strategies
This is a C implementation of the four evolutionary strategies:
 - 1 + 1 ES
 - μ + 1 ES 
 - μ , λ ES
 - μ + λ ES
 
 The objective is to minimize/maximize some equations, in the folder you can find the final report and source code of it.
